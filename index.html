    <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Charlie Pattinson is above all a curious mind. </p> <p>Primarily a graduate researcher at the University of Melbourne, Charlie study's 
      <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-022-01064-1" target="_blank"> Diamond Voltage Imaging Microscopes </a>
      and their use in understanding the electrical behaviour of biological systems.</p> 
      <p>In his spare time Charlie loves finding his physical limits around running, swimming and trying his best with cycling too to attempt some triathlons.</p>
      <p>Charlie is a keen outdoorsman, loving hiking and getting out in nature to learn about how ecological systems work and the clever adaptions nature has evolved in order to work in harmony.</p>
      <p>In this vein, Charlie also has a keen interest in biomimicry or bioinspiration, learning how biological systems harness thousands of years of evolution to create sustainable processes for operating sustainably.</p>
      <p>In all of these avenues Charlie is also a keen educator and science communicator, relishing any opportunity to share his curiosity with others.</p>

    <h2>Physics</h2>
    <p>Charlie started his Physics journey beginning with an undergraduate degree in Physics and a diploma in applied mathematics from the University of Melbourne.<br> 
      Charlie completed these degrees concurrently at the end of 2018. After a year working in big data management for technology consulting company Capgemini, Charlie returned to study his masters as Melbourne came into lockdown <br>
     Charlie explored further coursework receiving high marks in subjects such as condensed matter physics and quantum field theory while completing a research thesis under the supervision of Liam Hall, David Simpson, Nikolai Dontschuk and Daniel McCloskey <br>
    The research explored methods to modify the surface of diamond to make an effective sensor for measuring electrical activity in cells. <br>
    More specfically this was done by experimenting with electrochemical oxidation methods to modify the surface of a diamond substrate to achieve bespoke concentrations of hydrogen and oxygen groups on the surface. <br> 
    The study monitored the effectiveness of successive oxidations by measuring and characterising the fluorescence of nitrogen vacancy centres present in the positive, neutral and negative charge states.<br>
    Not only were the nitrogen vacancy centres reporters of the oxidaton effectiveness but at specific surface concentrations of hydrogen and oxygen they became highly sensitive sensors for measuring local electrical activity. Hence the Diamond Voltage Imaging Microscope, or DVIM for short.<br>
    The results of this research directly contributed to the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-022-01064-1" target="_blank"> previously linked article </a> demonstrating the DVIM in nanophotonics. <br>
    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-022-01064-1/figures/1" target="_blank"> Figure 1f.</a> shows the relatoinship between oxidation of the surface and the sensitivity of the device to local electical signals<br>

  </p>
  <p>
    Charlie is now undertaking his PhD at the University of Melbourne once again under the supervision of David Simpson, Nikolai Dontschuk and Daniel McCloskey looking at further improvements of the DVIM and applications to biological systems such as organoids (lab grown organs).
