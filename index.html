    <h2>Overview</h2>
    Charlie Pattinson is above all a curious mind. Primarily a graduate researcher at the University of Melbourne, Charlie study's 
    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-022-01064-1" target="_blank"> Diamond Voltage Imaging Microscopes </a>
    and their use in understanding the electrical behaviour of biological systems. 
    In his spare time Charlie loves finding his physical limits around running, swimming and trying his best with cycling too to attempt some triathlons. 
    Charlie is a keen outdoorsman, loving hiking and getting out in nature to learn about how ecological systems work and the clever adaptions nature has evolved in order to work in harmony.
    In this vein, Charlie also has a keen interest in biomimicry or bioinspiration, learning how biological systems harness thousands of years of evolution to create sustainable processes for operating sustainably.
    In all of these avenues Charlie is also a keen educator and science communicator, relishing any opportunity to share his curiosity with others.
