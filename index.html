    Charlie Pattinson is above all a curious mind. Primarily a graduate researcher at the University of Melbourne, Charlie study's

    and their use understanding the electrical behaviour of biological systems. 
    In his spare time Charlie loves finding his physical limits around running, swimming and trying his best with cycling too to attempt some triathlons. 
    Charlie is also a keen outdoorsman, loving hiking and getting out in nature and learning about how ecological systems work and the wonderful adaptions nature has evolved in order to work so sustainably in harmony.
    In this vein, Charlie also has a keen interest in biomimicry or bioinspiration, learning how biological systems harness thousands of years of evolution to create sustainable processes for operating their lives.
    In all of these avenues Charlie is also a keen educator and science communicator, relishing any opportunity to share his curiosity with others.
